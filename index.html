        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! my name is Juan Brea. I am 21 years old. I am Dominican.
            I moved to New York in 2015 and immediately fell in love with the city,
            its people, the diversity, everything! I love watching sports like basketball.
        </p>

        <p>I am a transfer student from
            <a href="http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">Bronx Community College</a>.
            I completed 2 years
            majoring in Liberal Arts in Bronx Community College, however, I changed my
            major to Computer Science when I transferred to
            <a href="http://lehman.edu" target="_blank">Lehman College</a>. Among the classes that I
            am taking as new computer science student is Programing through web
            development,<a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/" target="_blank"> CMP 128</a>,
            taught by Steven Fulakeza.
            I wish to accomplish my goal of graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer
            science at Lehman College, getting a job related to my career and live a fun life.

        </p>

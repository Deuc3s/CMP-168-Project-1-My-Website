# CMP-168-Project-1-My-Website - Juan Brea
 

Hello everyone!
This is my project for the class of CMP 128 taught by Professor Steven Fulakeza.
In this project we were asked to create a website to discuss about ourselves.
The purpose of this project is to display our skills and understanding of the HTML and CSS we have learned in class so far.
